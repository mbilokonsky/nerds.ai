# Problem
In this exercise, we are dealing with an async function named `fetchData` that fetches data from a URL and returns a result.

If the fetch operation fails, this function returns a tuple. The first member of this tuple contains the error message and the second member is irrelevant in this case.

If the operation is successful, the function also returns a tuple. However, this time, the first member is `undefined` and the second member contains the fetched data.

Here's how the function is currently implemented:

```typescript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const result = await fetch("/");

  if (!result.ok) {
    return [new Error("Could not fetch data.")];
  }

  const data = await result.json();

  return [undefined, data];
};
```

Here's an async `example` function that uses `fetchData` and includes a couple of test cases:

```typescript
const example = async () => {
  const [error, data] = await fetchData();

  type Tests = [
    Expect<Equal<typeof error, Error | undefined>>, // red squiggly line under Equal<>
    Expect<Equal<typeof data, any>>,
  ];
};
```

Currently, both members of the tuple are inferred as `any`, which isn't ideal.


```typescript
const [error, data] = await fetchData();

// hovering over error and data shows:
const error: any
const data: any
```

## Challenge

Your challenge is to modify the `fetchData` function implementation so that TypeScript infers a Promise with a tuple for its return type.

Depending on whether or not the fetch operation is successful, the tuple should contain either an error message or a pair of `undefined` and the data fetched.

Hint: There are two possible approaches to solve this challenge. One way would be to define an explicit return type for the function. Alternatively, you could attempt to add or change type annotations for the `return` values within the function.

# Resolution
As mentioned, there are two different solutions to this challenge.

## Solution 1: Defining a Return Type

The first solution is to define a return type for the `fetchData` function.

Inside the `Promise` type, a tuple is defined with either `Error` or `undefined` as the first member, and an optional `any` as the second member:

```typescript
const fetchData = async (): Promise<[Error | undefined, any?]> => {
  ...
```

This technique works, but it's a little cumbersome.

## Solution 2: Using `as const`

Instead of specifying a return type, the second solution is to use `as const` on the return values:

```typescript
import { Equal, Expect } from "@total-typescript/helpers";

const fetchData = async () => {
  const result = await fetch("/");

  if (!result.ok) {
    return [new Error("Could not fetch data.")] as const; // added as const here
  }

  const data = await result.json();

  return [undefined, data] as const; // added as const here
};
```

With these changes in place, when we check the return type of `fetchData` in the `example` function, we can see that `error` is inferred as `Error | undefined`, and `data` is `any`:

```tsx
const example = async () => {
  const [error, data] = await fetchData();
  ...

// hovering over error shows:
const error: Error | undefined

// hovering over data shows:
const data: any
```

Using `as const` sets a variable is read-only, which assists TypeScript in accurately assigning the type of tuples.

In the case of this challenge, without `as const`, TypeScript could misinterpret the return value as `Promise<any[]>`. However, by using `as const`, TypeScript correctly observes the return value as a tuple (`Promise<[string | undefined, any]>`).

In summary, both techniques offer unique benefits. The first technique provides a straightforward approach to type definition, while the second leverages TypeScript's inference capabilities.
